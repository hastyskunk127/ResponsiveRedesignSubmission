					<h2 class="subdivision-title">The Mission</h2>
					<p class="caption">My quest was simple - set out to find a website that could use a overhaul in terms of accessibility and ease of use, and get experience with visual redesign and generating responsive website.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h2 class="subdivision-title">The Website</h2>
					<p class="caption"> I set my sights upon Spectrum-India, a store prominently featured on Thayer St on my campus. The store has been around for a while and I've shopped here before. When I visited the website I was shocked to see how dated the website looked, and was initially quite overwhelmed by the scattering of text across the website. </p>

					<h2 class="subdivision-title">The Issues</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The first impression that the website gives upon loading is quite intimidating — in the words of a peer I spoke to, it felt like a blown out poster more than a website. </li>
						<li>Information is very scattered with a variety of links in irregular places, and the text lacks uniformity - different text has different font, size, and color without any real order to it. There is no clear hierarchy to the website. In terms of learnability and efficiency of browsing items the website is quite lacking.</li>
						<li>The text is also very small, and there is a lot of it, which can lead to a poor accessibility experience especially when combined with the low contrast.</li>
						<li>The layout also impacts the efficiency of purchasing items of the site, and even taking in what options there are to purchase. Because everything is so spread out the site is taxing on your memory, since it’s impossible to take in at first glance the different items.</li>
						<li>There is a navbar, which could help combat the issue of navigability. but it is very small and off to a corner.</li>
						<li>There is text at the very bottom indicating that pictures are expandable, but this isn’t apparent from looking or hovering over them, and not all pictures are expandable.</li>
						<li>Each section also has the link for actually viewing the item in a different area, without uniformity.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col">
					<h2 class="subdivision-title">Accessibility</h2>
					<p class="caption">The biggest issues WebWaive reported were the presence small text (67 instances!). This small text, matched with poor contrast, makes it hard to take in information at a glance. There is also a lack of header structure which reflects in the confusing reading order of the website. Throughout the page there is a lack of alternative text, which hinders its accessibility as well.
						Going on inspect element revealed the lack of a single div, which also might contribute to the irregularity of the sections
